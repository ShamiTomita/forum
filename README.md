Rails Weightlifting Forum

This is a Ruby on Rails forum project dedicated to weightlifters. Over my time on the internet, I've spent a considerable amount of time on different forums, specifically forums dedicated to both exercise and to the gay community. This project drew inspiration from those types of sites. In this domain, a user can create an account, publish their own threads, and search for and comment on others' forums.

This project helped illustrate the way that forums help to connect users and facilitate discussions, especially in terms of "wiring" certain routes together in order to make well thought out site-navigation. For example, Users can create their own new threads either from the navigation bar or when accessing their user profile page. In addition, creating a search function to help users access relevant threads was a good design challenge as well as a crucial feature to include.
